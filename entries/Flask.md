#Flask
---
Flask is a micro web framework written in [Python](/wiki/python). It is classified as a _microframework_ because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

##Components
The microframework Flask is based on the _Pocoo_ projects _Werkzeug_ and _Jinja2_.

####Werkzeug
Werkzeug is a utility library for the Python programming language, in other words a toolkit for Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) applications, and is licensed under a BSD License.

####Jinja
Jinja, also by Ronacher, is a template engine for the Python programming language and is licensed under a BSD License. Similar to the Django web framework, it handles templates in a sandbox.
